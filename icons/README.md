# BlockIT Pro Icons

This directory contains the extension icons:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (additional size)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Design Guidelines
- Use the BlockIT Pro branding colors
- Simple, recognizable shield or block symbol
- High contrast for visibility
- Professional appearance

## Status
âœ… All required icons are present and configured correctly in manifest.json

## Temporary Solution
Until proper icons are created, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files with these exact names.
